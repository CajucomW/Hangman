# hangman

A simple, python-powered, hangman game utilizing functions, conditions, and loops. I'll be trying to recreate an activity I learned from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstartcoding.com">KickStart Coding</a>, which I 'pseudocoded'. I will then use the pseudocode to recreate the game.
