HANGMAN GAME

- define word to guess (put in a variable)
- create and place an empty list of guessed letters in a variable

- write a function for the hidden word that needs to be guessed
    - guessed = blank string ""
    - for each letter in the word to guess:
        - if the letter is not in the guessed letters:
            - letter = '_'
        - hidden word = hidden word + letter + guessed/blank string
    - print the hidden word

- write a function for the game itself
    - define a limit to the number of wrong guesses
    - while wrong guesses is more than -1
        - invoke the previous (word to be guessed) function
        - print number of guesses left (number of wrong guesses)
        - print guessed letters from empty list. Here, use the '*' operator
            to flesh out the list
        - guess = input
        - if input and input is not in guessed letters (not sure why twice)
            - guessed letters append (guess)
            - if guess is in word to guess
                - print "Correct"
            - else
                - wrong guess left = wrong guess left - 1

* Using the 'set' class, I can check if a specific element is contained
    w/in a set/list

        - remaining letters = set(word to guess) - set(guessed letters)
        - if not in remaining letters
            - print "Win!"
            - return

    - print 'lose'
